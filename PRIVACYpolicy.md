# Privacy Policy for bankapp

Effective date: 2026-01-15

This Privacy Policy explains how Sachidananda Nath ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use the bankapp mobile application (the "App"). The App is a financial calculator designed to help with financial calculations and includes a built-in free document scanner utility that generates PDFs. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
- Personal Information: Information you voluntarily provide, such as name, email address, or other contact details when you contact us or create an account (if applicable).
- Financial Inputs and Calculation Data: Data you enter into the calculator (for example, amounts, rates, dates, loan details, or other financial parameters). This information may be stored locally on your device as calculation history if you enable that feature.
- Scanned Documents (PDFs): PDF files generated by the App’s document scanner. The scanner is a local PDF generator only (no OCR). See the Scanner Processing section for details.
- Usage Data: Automatically collected information about how you use the App (e.g., screens/features used, session duration, calculation frequency).
- Device Information: Device model, operating system, unique device identifiers, IP address, and mobile network information.
- Crash Reports and Diagnostics: Automatic reports generated to help us detect and fix bugs. Crash reports will not intentionally include full scanned document PDFs, but may include limited contextual data (e.g., app state, error logs) necessary for diagnosing the issue.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use collected information to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features, including calculation functions and the scanner.
- Store and present your calculation history and generated PDFs if you enable those features.
- Personalize your experience and preferences.
- Diagnose and fix technical issues and analyze usage to improve stability and features.
- Communicate with you (e.g., respond to support requests, send important updates).
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 3. Sensitive Information and Financial Data
- The App may process financial inputs you enter for calculation purposes. Treat any financial information entered as potentially sensitive.
- We recommend you do not include highly sensitive personal identification information (such as full social security numbers, passport numbers, or bank account passwords) in scanned documents or free-text fields unless necessary.
- If the App stores calculation histories or generated PDFs, those items are stored according to your device settings (local storage only unless you choose to export or back them up). We do not intentionally collect account credentials or full payment card numbers.

## 4. Scanner Processing and Storage
- Local-only PDF Generation: The scanner in bankapp is a local PDF generator only. No OCR is performed. Images are converted to PDF on the user's device.
- No Cloud or Server Storage: Scanned PDFs and any images remain on your device unless you explicitly choose to export, share, or back them up. The App does not upload scanned documents to our servers or any third-party servers for processing, OCR, or storage.
- User Controls: You can choose whether to save generated PDFs, export them (for example, share by email or cloud apps), or delete them. Please review in-app settings to control scanner behavior.

## 5. Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell personal information. We may share information with:
- Service providers and partners who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, hosting).
- Law enforcement, regulators, or other third parties when required by law or to protect our legal rights.
- In connection with a business transfer (e.g., merger, acquisition, sale of assets).

When we share data with third-party services (e.g., analytics providers), those services may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. We will disclose which providers are used where applicable.

## 6. Analytics and Third-Party Services
The App may use third-party analytics and crash-reporting tools (for example: Google Analytics for Firebase, Sentry, etc.). These services collect usage and device information, which they process according to their own policies. If you want details about the specific analytics/crash services used, contact us and we'll list them.

## 7. Data Retention
We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy, or as required by law. Usage and diagnostic data may be kept in aggregated or anonymized form for longer periods to improve the App. For generated PDFs or calculation history, retention depends on your device settings and any backups you choose to make.

## 8. Security
We use industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. Examples include encrypted transmission (HTTPS/TLS) for network transfers and standard device storage protections. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you export or back up PDFs to a cloud service, consider encrypting sensitive documents before uploading where appropriate.

## 9. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable local age). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

## 10. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data.
- Restrict or object to processing.
- Obtain a copy of your data.
To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling requests.

## 11. International Transfers
If we transfer personal data across borders, we take steps to ensure adequate protections are in place in accordance with applicable law (for example, model clauses or privacy frameworks). If you are concerned about cross-border transfers, contact us for details.

## 12. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy in the App or on our website with a new effective date.
